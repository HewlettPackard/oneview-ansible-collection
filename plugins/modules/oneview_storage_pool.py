module: oneview_storage_pool
short_description: Manage OneView Storage Pool resources.
description:
    - "Provides an interface to manage Storage Pool resources. Can add and remove."
version_added: '2.3.0'
requirements:
    - "python >= 2.7.9"
    - "hpeOneView >= 5.4.0"
author: "Gustavo Hennig (@GustavoHennig)"
options:
    state:
        description:
            - Indicates the desired state for the Storage Pool resource.
              C(present) will ensure data properties are compliant with OneView.
              From API500 onwards it is only possible to update its state.
              C(absent) will remove the resource from OneView, if it exists.
              From API500 onwards absent state is immutable.
