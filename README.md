# Ansible Collection for HPE OneView

This collection provides a series of Ansible modules and plugins for interacting with the HPE OneView Modules.

## Requirements

 - Ansible >= 2.9
 - python >= 2.7.9
 - [HPE OneView Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/hpeOneView/)

# Installation
To install HPE OneView collection hosted in Galaxy

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install hpe.oneview
```

To upgrade to the latest version of HPE OneView:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install hpe.oneview --force
```
To install HPE OneView collection from GitHub
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-ansible-collection.git
cd oneview-ansible-collection
ansible-galaxy collection build .
ansible-galaxy collection install <tar_file>
```

To install dependency packages
    
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
To install HPE OneView collection from Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t oneview-ansible-collections .
docker run -it --rm -v (pwd)/:/root/oneview-ansible-collections oneview-ansible-collections
```
That's it. If you would like to modify any role, simply modify role and re-run the image.

###  OneViewClient Configuration

#### Using a JSON Configuration File

To use the HPE OneView collection, you can store the configuration in a JSON file. This file is used to define the
settings, which will be used on the OneView appliance connection, like hostname, username, and password. Here's an
example:

```json
{
  "ip": "<ip>",
  "credentials": {
    "userName": "<userName>",
    "authLoginDomain": "",
    "password": "<password>"
  },
  "api_version": 2200
}
```

The `api_version` specifies the version of the Rest API to invoke. When not defined, it will pick 
the OneView appliance version as `default`

If your environment requires a proxy, define the proxy properties in the JSON file using the following syntax:

```json
  "proxy": "<proxy_host>:<proxy_port>"
```

:lock: Tip: Check the file permissions since the password is stored in clear-text.

The configuration file path must be provided for all of the roles `config` arguments. For example:

```yml
- name: Gather facts about the FCoE Network with name 'FCoE Network Test'
  oneview_fcoe_network_facts:
    config: "/path/to/config.json"
    name: "FCoE Network Test"
```

Once you have defined the config variables, you can run the roles.

#### Parameters in roles

The another way is to pass in your HPE OneView credentials to your tasks is through explicit specification on the task.

This option allows the parameters `hostname`, `username`, `password`, `api_version` and `image_streamer_hostname` to be passed directly inside your task.

```yaml
- name: Create a Fibre Channel Network
  oneview_fc_network:
    hostname: <hostname>
    username: <username>
    password: <password>
    api_version: 2200
    state: present
    data:
      name: "{{ network_name }}"
      fabricType: 'FabricAttach'
      linkStabilityTime: '30'
      autoLoginRedistribution: true
  no_log: true
  delegate_to: localhost
```

Setting `no_log: true` is highly recommended in this case, as the credentials are otherwise returned in the log after task completion.

### Setting your OneView version

The Ansible modules for HPE OneView support the API endpoints for HPE OneView 4.20, 5.00, 5.20, 5.30, 5.40, 5.50

The current `default` HPE OneView version will pick the OneView appliance version.

To use a different API, you must set the API version together with your credentials, either using the JSON configuration:

```json
"api_version": 2200
```
OR using the Environment variable:

```bash
export ONEVIEWSDK_API_VERSION='2200'
```

If this property is not specified, it will fall back to default value.

The API list is as follows:

- HPE OneView 4.20 API version: `1000`
- HPE OneView 5.00 API version: `1200`
- HPE OneView 5.20 API version: `1600`
- HPE OneView 5.30 API version: `1800`
- HPE OneView 5.40 API version: `2000`
- HPE OneView 5.50 API version: `2200`

### HPE Synergy Image Streamer

Modules to manage HPE Synergy Image Streamer appliances are also included in this project.
To use these modules, you must set the Image Streamer IP on the OneViewClient configuration,
either using the JSON configuration:

```json
"image_streamer_ip": "<image_streamer_ip>"
```

OR using the Environment variable:

```bash
export ONEVIEWSDK_IMAGE_STREAMER_IP='100.100.100.100'
```

### Usage

Playbooks
